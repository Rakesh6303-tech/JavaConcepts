/*
üîç Explanation
üî∏ 1. methodA()
Inside this method, you're performing 10 / 0, which causes an ArithmeticException (/ by zero).

This exception is caught by the catch (ArithmeticException e) block.

A message is printed:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Caught in methodA: / by zero
Then, the same exception is re-thrown using throw e.

üî∏ 2. main() Method
methodA() is called inside a try block.

Since methodA() rethrows the exception, it propagates back to main().

The catch (Exception e) block in main() catches it.

It prints:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Handled in main: java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
